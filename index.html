                <h2>Origin</h2>
                <p>The origin of name of the Rowntree's now Nestle's KitKat® is believed to be in an early 18th century
                    English gentlemen's club called the "Kit Cat Club", after its proprietor Mr. Christopher Catt who
                    provided sustenance -- Kit Cats -- which where given an abbreviation of his name.</p>
                <p>Here above the members can be shown performing the traditional toasting or roasting of a young girl,
                    Lady Mary Pierrepont, who is being made to stand on a chair, with their KitKats, which were made
                    available only to the male clientèle.</p>
                <p>Lady Mary Pierrepont, later Lady Mary Wortley Montagu, understandably, grew up to be a women's rights
                    activist who introduced small pox vaccinations into the UK. She travelled to the orient which she
                    wrote about with praise. She penned "Letters from Turkey" and "Woman not Inferior to Man."</p>
                <p>The KitKat Club was located at one time in Hampstead where the KitKat House stands to this day
                    (photo). Since I think Japanese travel to famous named places, often associated with origins, I
                    think that KitKat House is a potential Japanese tourist destination, especially if there were
                    speciality flavour KitKats (of which the Japanese have many, including sweet potato flavour) were on
                    sale.</p>
                <p>KitKat's are popular in Japan since they do not have as many calories as pure chocolate bars and
                    because their name puns on the Japanese words for definitely win, (kitto katsu) and so are given to
                    high school students taking Japanese university entrance examination as sustenance and a good luck
                    charm. But, little do they know the origin of the KitKat.</p>

                <h2>Taste & Texture</h2>
                <p>A KitKat tantalizes the taste buds with its delightful combination of flavors and textures. The outer
                    layer of creamy milk chocolate provides a smooth and rich sweetness that coats the palate. Beneath
                    this layer lies the heart of the KitKat - layers of crisp, light wafer that deliver a satisfying
                    crunch with every bite. This contrast between the smoothness of the chocolate and the crispiness of
                    the wafer creates a harmonious balance, making each mouthful a pleasure to savor. Whether enjoyed
                    whole or snapped into individual fingers, the taste and texture of a KitKat offer a uniquely
                    satisfying experience that is both comforting and indulgent.</p>

                <h2>Why should you try a KitKat?</h2>
                <p>If you haven't yet experienced the pleasure of a KitKat, you're missing out on a delightful
                    confectionary marvel. Offering a perfect harmony of crispy wafer and smooth milk chocolate, a KitKat
                    promises a sensory adventure that tantalizes the taste buds with each bite. Its iconic design, with
                    individual fingers just waiting to be snapped off and enjoyed one by one, adds an element of fun to
                    the experience. Whether you're looking for a quick snack to satisfy your sweet tooth or a treat to
                    share with friends and family, trying a KitKat is an invitation to indulge in a timeless classic
                    that never fails to delight.</p>
